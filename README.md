# winston-fast-rabbitmq

A RabbitMQ transport for Winston. It closes the connection after every message, but keeps the connection open as long as new messages arrive within a short timespan.

* Very few dependencies
* Easy to use and fast to implement
* Stable even when submitting several messages in a short timespan.
* Build on [amqplib](https://www.npmjs.com/package/amqplib)

# Usage

Use [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) to install the module:

```
	npm install winston-fast-rabbitmq
```

Then use `require()` to load it in your code:

```javascript
	var winstonFastRabbitMq = require('winston-fast-rabbitmq');
```

Setup the transport in winston:

```javascript
	winston.add(winstonFastRabbitMq, options);
```

That's it! Of course you need to have RabbitMQ up and running for this to work.

If you haven't, I'll just provide a link to their homepage as a service: [RabbitMQ](https://www.rabbitmq.com/).

## Options

You can of course provide options for setting up the transport and AMQP.


### level

String

Default: 'info'.

Sets the minimum required level for sending the log to RabbitMQ. You can find the levels [here](https://www.npmjs.com/package/winston#logging-levels).


### applicationId

String

Default: ''.

A name for the application sends the message. Used in the receiving application to identify where the message came from.


### handleError

Function

Default: See below.

A function for handling errors if it fails when sending the log to the queue.

The default function looks like this:
```javascript
	(ex) => {
		console.log('ERROR in winston-fast-rabbitmq: ' + util.inspect(ex, { depth: null }));
	}
```


### silent

boolean

Default: false.

If true, console-messages from winston-fast-rabbitmq will be suppressed. 

Bonus info! If you whan to suppress console messages from winston, just do this:

```javascript
	winston.remove(winston.transports.Console);
```


### wrapMessage

boolean

Default: true.

If true, messages will be wrapped in JSON where date and time is added using the toISOString() of the Date object.
The resulting object will look something like this: 

```javascript
	{"applicationId":"MyApp","datetime":"2016-06-19T13:06:14.451Z","level":"info","message":"We're testing the module!"}
```

### protocol

string

Default: 'amqp'

The protocol used to communicate with RabbitMQ (or perhaps another message queue?)


### host

string

Default: 'localhost'

The URI of the server that hosts the RabbitMQ.


### virtualHost

string

Default: ''

Used if RabbitMQ is configured with a virtual host on the server.


### port

number

Default: 5672

The port that is open for connections to RabbitMQ.

### username

string

Default: 'guest'

Use this if RabbitMQ if credentials is required.


### password

string

Default: 'guest'

### exchangeType

Default: 'topic'

The topic for the exchange.


### exchangeName

string

Default: 'winstonLog'

The name for the exchange.


# Tests

To run tests on this module, make sure that the modules for the tests are installed

```
	npm install winston-fast-rabbitmq --dev
```

Then run:

```
	npm test
```

NOTICE: The test is not only a unit test but also a functionality test. So rabbitMQ is required to be installed locally in order to run the test.

In one of the tests, 1000 messages are send to the queue. It runs in about 12 seconds so don't be nervous if it seems to stall for a while.
